## Evitec Homework Part II: Cypress spec for Postimees website

The tests were written using cypress. The log in/out functionalities for the website was not tested, since handling iframes did not work, but other basic functionalities were tested.

An extra package was added to Cypress, which creates automated .html reports, these were added to the reports folder. The name of the report is index.html. No custom functions were used, since the spec tests different functionalities of the website, and does not repeat itself too much.

If there is any problems accessing the code, or extra questions, email me: jakob.haud@gmail.com
